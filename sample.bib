Intratumor phenotypic and functional heterogeneity have been linked primarily by physical sorting experiments, which assume that functionally distinct subpopulations can be prospectively isolated by surface phenotypes. This assumption has proven problematic, and we therefore developed a data-driven approach. Using mass cytometry, we profiled surface and intracellular signaling proteins simultaneously in millions of healthy and leukemic cells. We developed PhenoGraph, which algorithmically defines phenotypes in high-dimensional single-cell data. PhenoGraph revealed that the surface phenotypes of leukemic blasts do not necessarily reflect their intracellular state. Using hematopoietic progenitors, we defined a signaling-based measure of cellular phenotype, which led to isolation of a gene expression signature that was predictive of survival in independent cohorts.

The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors has led to durable control of disease in a subset of advanced cancer patients, such as those with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. However, predicting patient responses to therapy remains a major challenge, due to the remarkable genomic, epigenetic, and microenvironmental heterogeneity present in each tumor. Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women, where hormone receptor-positive (HR+; estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor) BC comprises the majority and has better prognosis, while a minority are triple negative BC (TNBC), which has an aggressive phenotype. There is a clinical need to identify predictors of late recurrence in HR+ BC and predictors of immunotherapy outcomes in advanced TNBC. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have recently been shown to predict late recurrence in HR+, counter to the findings that TILs confer good prognosis in TNBC and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) subtypes. Furthermore, the spatial arrangement of TILs also appears to have prognostic value, with dense clusters of immune cells predicting poor prognosis in HR+ and good prognosis in TNBC. Whether TIL clusters in different breast cancer subtypes represent the same or different landscapes of TILs is unknown and may have treatment implications for a significant portion of breast cancer patients. Current histopathological staining technology is not sufficient for characterizing the ensembles of TILs and their spatial patterns, in addition to tumor and microenvironmental heterogeneity. However, recent advances in cyclic immunofluorescence enable differentiation of the subsets based on TILs, tumor heterogeneity, and microenvironment composition between good and poor responders. A computational framework for understanding the importance of the spatial relationships between TILs and tumor cells in cancer tissues, which will allow for quantitative interpretation of cyclic immunostaining, is also under development. This chapter will explore the workflow for a newly developed cyclic multiplexed-immunofluorescence (cmIF) assay, which has been optimized for formalin-fixed. paraffin-embedded tissues and developed to process digital images for quantitative single-cell based spatial analysis of tumor heterogeneity and microenvironment, including immune cell composition.}, booktitle={Biomarkers for Immunotherapy of Cancer: Methods and Protocols}, publisher={Springer}, author={Eng, Jennifer and Thibault, Guillaume and Luoh, Shiuh-Wen and Gray, Joe W. and Chang, Young Hwan and Chin, Koei}, year={2020}, pages={521–562}, collection={Methods in Molecular Biology} }

We characterized thousands of unique binding events as well as bivalent chromatin signatures unique to each cancer subtype, which were involved in different epigenetic regulation programs and signaling pathways in breast cancer progression. Genes linked to the unique histone mark features exhibited subtype-specific expression patterns, both in cancer cell lines and primary tumors, some of which were confirmed by qPCR in our primary cancer samples.

 @article{pdl1a2015, title={PD-L1 protein expression in breast cancer is rare, enriched in basal-like tumours and associated with infiltrating lymphocytes}, volume={26}, ISSN={0923-7534}, DOI={10.1093/annonc/mdv192}, abstractNote={Background
Expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in solid tumours has been shown to predict whether patients are likely to respond to anti-PD-L1 therapies. To estimate the therapeutic potential of PD-L1 inhibition in breast cancer, we evaluated the prevalence and significance of PD-L1 protein expression in a large collection of breast tumours.
Patients and methods
Correlations between CD274 (PD-L1) copy number, transcript and protein levels were evaluated in tumours from 418 patients recruited to the METABRIC genomic study. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect PD-L1 protein in breast tumours in tissue microarrays from 5763 patients recruited to the SEARCH population-based study (N = 4079) and the NEAT randomised, controlled trial (N = 1684).
Results
PD-L1 protein data was available for 3916 of the possible 5763 tumours from the SEARCH and NEAT studies. PD-L1 expression by immune cells was observed in 6 (235/3916) of tumours and expression by tumour cells was observed in just 1.7 (66/3916). PD-L1 was most frequently expressed in basal-like tumours. This was observed both where tumours were subtyped by combined copy number and expression profiling [39 (17/44) of IntClust 10 i.e. basal-like tumours were PD-L1 immune cell positive; P < 0.001] and where a surrogate IHC-based classifier was used [19 (56/302) of basal-like tumours were PD-L1 immune cell positive; P < 0.001]. Moreover, CD274 (PD-L1) amplification was observed in five tumours of which four were IntClust 10. Expression of PD-L1 by either tumour cells or infiltrating immune cells was positively correlated with infiltration by both cytotoxic and regulatory T cells (P < 0.001). There was a nominally significant association between PD-L1 and improved disease-specific survival (hazard ratio 0.53, 95 confidence interval 0.26–1.07; P = 0.08) in ER-negative disease.
Conclusions
Expression of PD-L1 is rare in breast cancer, markedly enriched in basal-like tumours and is correlated with infiltrating lymphocytes. PD-L1 inhibition may benefit the 19 of patients with basal-like tumours in which the protein is expressed.

Targeting of PD-L1 and other immune checkpoint proteins has shown therapeutic activity in various tumor types. The expression of PD-L1 and its correlation with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer has not been studied extensively. Our goal was to assess PD-L1 expression in a cohort of breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Pretreatment biopsies from 105 patients with breast cancer from Yale New Haven Hospital that subsequently received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were assessed for PD-L1 protein expression by automated quantitative analysis with a rabbit monoclonal antibody (E1L3N) to the cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1. In addition, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were assessed on hematoxylin and eosin slides. PD-L1 expression was observed in 30 of patients, and it was positively associated with hormone-receptor–negative and triple-negative status and high levels of TILs. Both TILs and PD-L1 measured in the epithelium or stroma predicted pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in univariate and multivariate analyses. However, because they are strongly associated, TILs and PD-L1 cannot both be included in a significant multivariate model. PD-L1 expression is prevalent in breast cancer, particularly hormone-receptor–negative and triple-negative patients, indicating a subset of patients that may benefit from immune therapy. Furthermore, PD-L1 and TILs correlate with pCR, and high PD-L1 predicts pCR in multivariate analysis.

During the last 15 years, 5 intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, Basal-like and Claudin-low) have been identified and intensively studied. In this review, we will focus on the current and future clinical implications of the intrinsic molecular subtypes beyond the current pathological-based classification endorsed by the 2013 St. Gallen Consensus Recommendations. Within hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative early breast cancer, the Luminal A and B subtypes predict 10-year outcome regardless of systemic treatment administered as well as residual risk of distant recurrence after 5 years of endocrine therapy. Within clinically HER2-positive disease, the 4 main intrinsic subtypes can be identified and dominate the biological and clinical phenotype. From a clinical perspective, patients with HER2+/HER2-enriched disease seem to benefit the most from neoadjuvant trastuzumab, or dual HER2 blockade with trastuzumab/lapatinib, in combination with chemotherapy, and patients with HER2+/Luminal A disease seem to have a relative better outcome compared to the other subtypes. Finally, within triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the Basal-like disease predominates (70–80) and, from a biological perspective, should be considered a cancer-type by itself. Importantly, the distinction between Basal-like versus non-Basal-like within TNBC might predict survival following (neo)adjvuvant multi-agent chemotherapy, bevacizumab benefit in the neoadjuvant setting (CALGB40603), and docetaxel vs. carboplatin benefit in first-line metastatic disease (TNT study). Overall, this data suggests that intrinsic molecular profiling provides clinically relevant information beyond current pathology-based classifications.}, journal={The Breast}, author={Prat, Aleix and Pineda, Estela and Adamo, Barbara and Galván, Patricia and Fernández, Aranzazu and Gaba, Lydia and Díez, Marc and Viladot, Margarita and Arance, Ana and Muñoz, Montserrat}, year={2015}, month={Nov}, pages={S26–S35}, collection={14th St.Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference – Proceedings Book} }

To validate this platform, we used tissue microarrays containing 38 archival head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and revealed differential immune profiles based on lymphoid and myeloid cell densities, correlating with human papilloma virus status and prognosis. Based on these results, we investigated 24 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas from patients who received neoadjuvant GVAX vaccination and revealed that response to therapy correlated with degree of mono-myelocytic cell density and percentages of CD8+ T cells expressing T cell exhaustion markers. These data highlight the utility of in situ immune monitoring for patient stratification and provide digital image processing pipelines to the community for examining immune complexity in precious tissue sections, where phenotype and tissue architecture are preserved to improve biomarker discovery and assessment.}, number={1}, journal={Cell Reports}, author={Tsujikawa, Takahiro and Kumar, Sushil and Borkar, Rohan N. and Azimi, Vahid and Thibault, Guillaume and Chang, Young Hwan and Balter, Ariel and Kawashima, Rie and Choe, Gina and Sauer, David and et al.}, year={2017}, pages={203–217} }

Transformative single-cell genomics technologies and spatial multiplex in situ methods now provide an opportunity to interrogate this complexity at unprecedented resolution. The Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Moonshot Initiative, will establish a clinical, experimental, computational, and organizational framework to generate informative and accessible three-dimensional atlases of cancer transitions for a diverse set of tumor types. This effort complements both ongoing efforts to map healthy organs and previous large-scale cancer genomics approaches focused on bulk sequencing at a single point in time. Generating single-cell, multiparametric, longitudinal atlases and integrating them with clinical outcomes should help identify novel predictive biomarkers and features as well as therapeutically relevant cell types, cell states, and cellular interactions across transitions. The resulting tumor atlases should have a profound impact on our understanding of cancer biology and have the potential to improve cancer detection, prevention, and therapeutic discovery for better precision-medicine treatments of cancer patients and those at risk for cancer.}, number={2}, journal={Cell}, author={Rozenblatt-Rosen, Orit and Regev, Aviv and Oberdoerffer, Philipp and Nawy, Tal and Hupalowska, Anna and Rood, Jennifer E. and Ashenberg, Orr and Cerami, Ethan and Coffey, Robert J. and Demir, Emek and et al.}, year={2020}, month={Apr}, pages={236–249} }

The lack of targeted therapies and the poor prognosis of patients with TNBC have fostered a major effort to discover actionable molecular targets to treat patients with these tumours. Massively parallel sequencing and other ‘omics’ technologies have revealed an unexpected level of heterogeneity of TNBCs and have led to the identification of potentially actionable molecular features in some TNBCs, such as germline BRCA1/2 mutations or ‘BRCAness’, the presence of the androgen receptor, and several rare genomic alterations. Whether these alterations are molecular ‘drivers’, however, has not been clearly established. A subgroup of TNBCs shows a high degree of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes that also correlates with a lower risk of disease relapse and a higher likelihood of benefit from chemotherapy. Proof‑of‑principle studies with immune-checkpoint inhibitors in advanced-stage TNBC have yielded promising results, indicating the potential benefit of immunotherapy for patients with TNBC. In this Review, we discuss the most relevant molecular findings in TNBC from the past decade and the most promising therapeutic opportunities derived from these data.}, number={11}, journal={Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology}, author={Bianchini, Giampaolo and Balko, Justin M. and Mayer, Ingrid A. and Sanders, Melinda E. and Gianni, Luca}, year={2016}, month={Nov}, pages={674–690} }

Increased adiposity in postmenopausal women may trigger signaling pathways that induce aromatase expression. In breast adipose fibroblasts, increased TNF production may induce the distal aromatase promoter, whereas increased local PGE2 production may induce the proximal promoter region. We review here the mechanisms that control aromatase gene expression in breast adipose tissue, and the paracrine interactions between malignant breast epithelial cells and the surrounding adipose fibroblasts. Systematic characterization of these signaling pathways will facilitate the identification of potential drug targets to selectively reduce aromatase expression and excessive estrogen production, with therapeutic benefit.}, number={2}, journal={Trends in endocrinology and metabolism: TEM}, author={Bulun, Serdar E. and Chen, Dong and Moy, Irene and Brooks, David C and Zhao, Hong}, year={2012}, month={Feb}, pages={83–89} }

Patients and Methods Formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded tumor blocks were retrospectively collected from patients in the monotherapy arms of the Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial and centrally tested for ER, PgR and HER-2. ER and PgR were scored using continuous scales and HER-2 was scored as 0 to 3ϩ with 2ϩ cases being analyzed by ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization.
Results Blocks were collected from 2,006 of 5,880 eligible patients. Tissue was assessable and ER and/or PgR positivity conﬁrmed centrally in 1,782 cases. In these, TTR was longer for anastrozole than for tamoxifen by a similar extent to that in the overall trial. None of the three biomarkers identiﬁed a set of patients with differential beneﬁt from anastrozole over tamoxifen. Patients with low ER, low PgR, and high HER-2 expression had a poorer prognosis with either drug. Only 2.6\% of patients in the highest quartile of PgR experienced recurrence after 5 years, compared with 13.2\% in the lowest quartile.
Conclusion Quantitative expression of ER and PgR and HER-2 status did not identify patients with differential relative beneﬁt from anastrozole over tamoxifen: TTR was longer for anastrozole than for tamoxifen in all molecular subgroups. Low ER or PgR or high HER-2 expression are associated with a high risk of recurrence with either anastrozole or tamoxifen.}, number={7}, journal={Journal of Clinical Oncology}, author={Dowsett, Mitch and Allred, Craig and Knox, Jill and Quinn, Emma and Salter, Janine and Wale, Chris and Cuzick, Jack and Houghton, Joan and Williams, Norman and Mallon, Elizabeth and et al.}, year={2008}, month={Mar}, pages={1059–1065} }
